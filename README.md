# Final-year-project-LoRaWAN
## Performance Measurement of various security mechanisms and simulation of ChaCha encryption and BLAKE2s integrity algorithm for the LoRaWAN network

LoRaWAN network with 2 end devices , 1 gateway and 1 network server is implemented in Network Simulator 3 simulation tool  using C++ and network analysis is done. 

Various confidentiality and integrity algorithms are analyzed for performance metrics like speed, latency etc using CryptoPP library  and study of security features of algorithms are done to finalize an efficient and secure algorithm for confidentiality (ChaCha) and integrity(BLAKE2s).

ChaCha and BLAKE2s algorithm are implemented into the LoRaWAN Network created and metrics like Packet Delivery Rate and Throughput are measured.
